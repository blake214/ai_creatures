# AI Creatures
AI Creatures is an ambitious 3rd-year project that delves deep into genetic algorithms and reinforcement learning. Leveraging the pyBullet library for creating dynamic physics environments and working extensively with URDF files, I embarked on a journey to birth virtual "creatures" with a unique ability to evolve and adapt within the digital ecosystem. These creatures, initially rudimentary in form, undergo a transformative process where they breed, mutate, and strive for survival in their simulated habitat. By the culmination of the simulation, the once nascent creature emerges as a highly adapted and 'fitter' entity, thanks to its genetic evolution.

The fitness of these AI creatures is measured based on the distance they move within the simulation, a testament to their adaptability and progress.

## Highlights
- **Harnessing pyBullet Physics Environment:** I harnessed the power of the pyBullet physics environment, creating a dynamic world where virtual creatures could evolve, adapt, and learn.
- **Robotics with URDFs:** By applying robotics methodologies and working extensively with URDF files, I crafted virtual creatures within the digital habitat, endowing them with joints and motive capabilities.
- **Genetic Algorithm Mastery:** The core of the project lies in the development of a genetic algorithm that evaluates, breeds, and mutates generations of creatures, paving the way for the emergence of progressively 'fitter' and more resilient entities.
- **Parallel Processing Environments:** To expedite the evolutionary process, I designed and implemented multiprocessing environments, allowing multiple generations to run simultaneously, accelerating the pace of adaptation.

## Project Inspiration
This project draws inspiration from Karl Sims' iconic "Evolving Virtual Creatures" experiment, seeking to replicate artificial evolution in a virtual landscape. https://www.karlsims.com/papers/siggraph94.pdf
